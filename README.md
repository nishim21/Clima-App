# Clima-App
This app forecasts the weather of the device's current location or the city entered by the user.
The app uses OpenWeather API to fetch the weather information of any location.
To use the app, one needs to get his own API ID from the official website of OpenWeather API by creating an account.
After you get your own API ID, all you need to do is to replace the value of the string "APP_ID" in the class "WeatherController.java" with your own API ID.
That's it! Here you go!
